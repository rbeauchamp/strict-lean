# 8. Tooling and Machine Audit

## Overview

Modules 0–7 define the Lean properties a conforming development must have. This module defines the Lean-specific evidence needed to establish those properties: an exact elaboration environment, complete Lake module coverage, environment-level declaration inspection, exact axiom sets, and checked documentation examples. It separately defines qualification rules for projects implementing a checker and an optional serialized-declaration-graph check. Those conditional activities are not part of every adopter's ordinary conformance run. Semantic review remains necessary to establish that the checked statements express the intended claims.

A successful command establishes only the property it checks. In particular, an unextended `lake build` elaborates configured targets; it does not establish complete module coverage, absence of project axioms, a claimed foundation profile, or correctness of Markdown examples by itself.

## 8.1 Declare the Elaboration Environment

**Requirement**: Every conformance claim MUST name the exact Lean toolchain and exact dependency source state under which its source was elaborated.

- `lean-toolchain` MUST identify one exact Lean toolchain.
- Git dependencies MUST resolve to exact revisions in `lake-manifest.json`. For path dependencies or locally modified checkouts, the claim MUST also identify the source state used; a directory path or nominal Git revision alone does not identify modified contents.
- The reported environment MUST include `lean --version`, the claimed Lake library and executable targets, and the resolved Mathlib revision when Mathlib is present.
- A result obtained under another Lean or Mathlib revision is a result about that other elaboration environment. It MUST NOT be silently reused.

Parsing, elaboration, generated declarations, tactics, theorem names, and reduction behavior can change with the toolchain or dependencies. The gate reports the environment it loads. Its declaration results do not prove that a dependency checkout matches its recorded revision.

## 8.2 Define Surfaces Through Lake Semantics

**Requirement**: Claimed surfaces MUST be identified through Lake targets. Under the shipped manifest schema, each surface names one `lean_lib` in the root package and MAY claim standalone `lean_exe` roots by target name. An executable claim includes its exact Lake-resolved root module, such as `Main`. The module inventory MUST come from Lake's elaborated configuration, not a separately maintained file list or namespace-prefix search. The current checker requires at least one nonempty library surface. Executable-only packages can be valid Lean projects, but this schema does not support them.

This repository's checkers load the checked project's workspace through Lake's loader and read the elaborated root-package model directly: every `lean_lib` name, each library's exact module array and each module's Lake-resolved source file, every `lean_exe` name with its exact root module and source, and the root package's compiled-module directory. Because the elaborated model is the same object Lake builds from, `lakefile.lean` and `lakefile.toml` projects take the identical discovery path, and no custom Lake facets or lakefile edits are required from an adopter.

For a library `Lib`, Lake's built-in `modules` facet exposes a related view: it adds transitive imports that Lake assigns to that library. It equals the configured module array only when those imports are already covered. Use the configured array for the manifest inventory and reconcile any additional imported modules. Do not treat the two views as interchangeable. The facet can be queried with:

```sh
lake query Lib:modules --json
```

The audit MUST:

1. fail if the Lake workspace load, configuration, or surface manifest is missing or malformed, and reconcile every root-package Lean library and every root-package `lean_exe` target with exactly one positive or excluded manifest entry;
2. import and inspect every exact module returned for the claimed library and the exact root module of every claimed executable;
3. reconcile that exact set with the module attribution recorded in the elaborated environment;
4. fail on an omitted configured module or claimed executable root, an unexpected project module, or a module whose ownership cannot be determined; and
5. keep intentionally invalid fixtures outside every positive library surface.

The surface manifest is JSON with exactly four top-level keys: `schema-version` (equal to `2`), `surfaces`, `excluded-libraries`, and `excluded-executables`. It lives at the checked project's root as `foundation_manifest.json` unless an explicit `--manifest PATH` is given, and the checkers audit the project found from the current directory unless an explicit `--project DIR` is given.

Each surface names one `library`, a foundation `claim`, and a `rationale`, MAY list claimed `executables` by `lean_exe` target name, and MAY set `execution` to `report` (the default) or `checked` for the §8.6 execution-coverage claim; each exclusion entry names the target and its `rationale`. Unknown keys, duplicates, a wrong schema version, an unknown `execution` value, an empty `surfaces` array, or a target Lake does not elaborate fail closed. Empty exclusion arrays are valid for an adopter with nothing to exclude.

Claiming an executable whose root module already belongs to a manifested library, or excluding an executable whose root module belongs to a claimed library, is a manifest conflict and fails: a claimed executable root must be a standalone root module such as `Main`.

Library globs are therefore load-bearing. If a project intends every module below `Lib` to be in scope, its Lake configuration must use a glob with that meaning, such as ``.andSubmodules `Lib``. An umbrella import alone is insufficient: a valid but unimported source file can otherwise be absent from both `lake build` and the declaration inventory.

Declaration ownership is the exact module index Lean records. A declaration name that begins with `Lib`, a module named `LibLookalike`, or a private/internal-looking name does not establish or remove ownership. To catch a root-package module imported outside every configured library, the audit resolves each imported module's `.olean` through Lean and compares its origin with Lake's root-package output directory. A root-owned import absent from the claimed library modules and claimed standalone executable roots fails before its declarations can escape classification. Exclusion records classify targets for inventory purposes; they do not permit a claimed module to import an excluded module.

When a claim inspects independently loaded Lean environments, the audit MUST retain
each requested environment's identity and exact module assignment. Declaration names
are unique within one Lean environment; distinct environments may legitimately contain
different declarations with the same name, including `main`. Their inventories MUST NOT
be treated as one loaded environment. Declaration policies, generated-role evidence,
execution requests, replay, transcripts, histories and origins MUST be resolved in the
environment of the requested observation. The complete claim still requires every
positively assigned module and the global target-classification checks above.

## 8.3 Clean Elaboration and Diagnostics

**Requirement**: Every module in a positive surface MUST elaborate successfully from source in a fresh Lean/Lake build state, and the audit MUST reject every emitted warning.

- The audit build MUST use empty root-package build output or an isolated disposable copy. Pre-existing or fixture-produced root-package `.olean` files MUST NOT satisfy a fresh conformance claim. Dependencies may use existing artifacts under the declared environment; this is not a clean rebuild of the entire dependency graph.
- Warning rejection MUST be enforced by the audit driver from Lean/Lake diagnostics. A source file cannot make its own warning disappear from conformance by setting `warningAsError := false` locally.
- The build output and exit status MUST both be checked. A zero exit with a warning is not a warning-free result.
- For the checker qualification in §8.8, restore and recheck the positive control after a negative mutation. The qualification harness must keep the mutation’s artifacts from satisfying that control.

This repository's normal declaration gate uses an isolated copy under the checked project's `tmp/`. It omits VCS data, Lake build state, and artifact caches; shares dependency checkouts through `.lake/packages`; and re-anchors relative path dependencies recorded in the manifest to their original directories. A missing relative dependency fails as `lake-workspace-load-failed`. The copy starts with empty root-package output and is removed afterward. Lake can reuse existing dependency artifacts and may rebuild missing or invalidated dependencies. This establishes fresh source elaboration for the claimed root-package surface, not fresh checking of every imported dependency. Disabling a linter can prevent it from emitting a warning but does not discharge the semantic property the linter was intended to check.

`lake build` remains necessary to elaborate source, run command elaborators and linters, and produce the `.olean` files used by later checks. Successful elaboration alone does not establish checked admission: metaprogramming APIs and local options can store unchecked declarations. Before accepting proof, positive-fence, or correspondence evidence, the gate MUST complete kernel checking of every owned logical declaration and its owned dependencies, including mutual inductive groups and their generated constructors and recursors. Imported dependencies outside the owned inventory remain the declared trusted base. Authored unsafe/partial declarations remain forbidden; generated helpers require §8.4's separate authentication and cannot supply logical evidence. Unsupported or incomplete admission fails the affected claim. The shipped project, file, fence, and build-linter paths share `Admission.validate`. It forces the completed environment, excludes owned declarations from the imported replay base, replays safe non-partial declarations with pinned `Lean.Kernel.Environment.replay`, and checks coverage before report construction. Source option restoration or checking a new reference to a stored theorem cannot substitute for this dependency admission. This does not recheck the whole imported dependency graph or establish the optional §8.9 claim.

## 8.4 Inventory Every Owned Declaration

**Requirement**: The gate MUST inspect Lean's elaborated `Environment` and emit one record for every constant attributed to every exact owned module.

Each record MUST include at least:

- exact declaration name and exact owning module;
- exhaustive `ConstantInfo` kind (`axiom`, theorem, definition, opaque definition, inductive, constructor, recursor, or quotient declaration);
- whether the elaborated type is a proposition, so proof-valued definitions and instances cannot hide outside a theorem-only scan;
- instance and `noncomputable` metadata;
- `ConstantInfo.isUnsafe` and `ConstantInfo.isPartial` information;
- runtime replacement and external-code metadata (`@[implemented_by]`, `@[extern]`);
- the exact transitive axiom set from `Lean.collectAxioms`; and
- Lean-native generated-role metadata, such as projection, matcher, recursor, or compiler-generated partial helper.

The policy applies to public, protected, private, internal-looking, authored, and generated declarations. Final-`Environment` role metadata is descriptive: public metaprogramming APIs can synthesize names, ranges, declarations, and extension tags. Such metadata may explain a declaration; it MUST NOT by itself waive a project axiom, `sorryAx`, unknown axiom, or authored unsafe/partial declaration, and it MUST NOT hide a runtime replacement or external declaration from the §8.6 execution account.

Lean may emit a range-less internal `isPartial` code-generation helper for a safe, termination-checked recursive `def`. The helper is permitted only when all of the following hold:

- its final declaration is an opaque-hinted partial definition with no range, unsafe flag, runtime replacement, external marker, or axioms beyond the base;
- the linked base is present in the same module, safe, non-partial, regular-hinted, and tagged by Lean as recursive, with the same elaborated type and level parameters;
- the base/helper mutual-group lists map exactly through Lean's `._unsafe_rec` transformation, and the helper's entire value is exactly Lean 4.34.0's pinned recursive-constant replacement of the built-in structural or well-founded predefinition stored for the base;
- Lean can independently generate a kernel-checked unfolding theorem whose type is exactly the one-step equation reconstructed from that predefinition and whose axioms stay within the standard logical foundations (`propext`, `Quot.sound`, `Classical.choice`) or the base's own axiom set; and
- a fresh re-elaboration of the exact Lake-resolved source shows that Lean's built-in literal declaration elaborator first introduced the base and helper together in the base declaration, at any namespace depth: at top level, inside `namespace … end` blocks, in a nested `where` definition, or through Lean's built-in dotted-name declaration expansion. The transcript records the main module, the source byte count, the parsed imports, the Lean version, and the Lean build commit. The checker compares the source byte-for-byte before and after elaboration, and the audit invocation consumes the transcript directly. For this recursive-helper exception, the checker does not require one exact elaborator chain or tactic spelling. Instead, every recorded command, tactic, and term evaluator must be pinned: Lean's anonymous built-in scaffolding, a syntax macro registered in the command's environment (macros are pure syntax transformations whose expansions are re-audited), or an elaborator registered for that exact syntax kind in the module's post-import environment (the pinned toolchain or an explicitly imported library). Term attribution includes unfinished terms and alternative elaboration choices. `run_tac`, `by_elab`, elaborators defined in the audited module itself, ambiguous attribution, and unsupported recursion forms fail closed: the semantic evidence above can be fabricated by any evaluator path that executes audited-source metaprograms.

As a checker limit, not a property of Lean, the `termination_by`/`decreasing_by` block of an otherwise accepted recursive definition may use any tactic elaborator registered by the pinned toolchain or an imported library and any macro (module-local macros included, since their expansions are re-audited), but not `run_tac`, `by_elab`, or a term/tactic elaborator defined in the audited module itself. Term evaluators nested in those proofs must satisfy the same attribution condition; such a definition is rejected even though Lean accepts it.

Missing, ambiguous, imported-only, or semantically mismatched evidence fails. A macro or custom command cannot replace the required literal declaration origin. Allowed macros inside that declaration remain subject to the evaluator checks above. Name suffixes and strings such as `._native.`, `_private`, `.rec`, or `_unsafe_rec` are never authority by themselves. For nested recursion, the transcript must also identify the exact constant binder at the base's selection range within the literal containing declaration command. Containment alone does not authenticate a declaration. The supported `specialize` attribute path requires its exact syntax kinds and the same registered handler object as the fresh pinned compiler baseline; its navigation reference alone is insufficient.

If a `ConstantInfo` variant or relevant metadata cannot be classified, the affected claim is incomplete and cannot support conformance.

## 8.5 Proof Completeness and Foundation Strength

**Requirement**: Every owned declaration MUST be checked for forbidden assumptions, and every declaration with an admissible logical axiom set MUST receive its least permissive foundation label. Forbidden or compiler-trusting sets are classified separately and rejected from conforming positive surfaces.

Assign the least permissive label containing the declaration’s exact axiom set. A surface’s selected profile is an upper bound and does not replace the per-declaration label:

| Label | Permitted transitive axioms |
| --- | --- |
| **Kernel-only** | `{}` |
| **Choice-Free** | any subset of `{propext, Quot.sound}` |
| **Standard-Logical** | any subset of `{propext, Quot.sound, Classical.choice}` |

The gate MUST reject:

- every owned logical `axiom` declaration, whether or not another declaration depends on it; Lean 4 has no `constant` command, and an implemented `opaque` definition is classified separately;
- `sorryAx` anywhere in a transitive axiom set, including uses introduced by `sorry` or `admit`;
- every unknown axiom;
- every declaration that exceeds its surface's claimed profile; and
- every omitted or unclassified declaration.

The proof surface includes theorems and every definition or instance whose elaborated type is a proposition. A declaration of a proposition (`P : Prop`) defines a statement; a declaration whose type is `P` supplies evidence of it. Ordinary data and function definitions are still inventoried and may not conceal project axioms, holes, unknown axioms, or forbidden computational mechanisms.

A compiler-generated native-proof axiom is not accepted because its name, internal bit, or range appears native. The gate must establish the exact axiom type `@decide P inst = true`, the parent's exact `@of_decide_eq_true P inst axiom` proof value, and a successful independent native replay of that Boolean expression. Fresh re-elaboration of the exact source must also show that the built-in literal declaration elaborator first introduced both declarations and that the built-in `native_decide` evaluator occupies the axiom's exact source range. The recorded command/tactic chain must match the supported built-in native-proof path. Every recorded evaluator must meet §8.4's attribution condition, including term, unfinished-term, and alternative-choice attribution. Neither `run_tac` nor `by_elab` can authorize a generated native proof. Missing, ambiguous, or custom frontend attribution fails. Only then is the dependent declaration classified as **compiler-trusting**. Compiler-trusting is not one of the three logical labels and is nonconforming on a kernel-checked positive surface.

This authorization boundary assumes the pinned Lean process and explicitly imported trusted libraries are not compromised. Arbitrary hostile trusted plugins or process compromise are out of scope. Audited-source custom or ambiguous evaluator paths remain in scope and fail closed.

### Explicit application contracts

A complete executable component MUST encode its required behavioral propositions as proof requirements tied to the actual definitions through dependent result types, proof-bearing interfaces consumed by the application, or semantic checks against explicit expected propositions. Removing evidence while its requirement remains MUST fail elaboration or the gate. A trivial or weaker proposition cannot discharge the unchanged obligation. Existing construction, library proofs, and composition MAY discharge these requirements without a redundant theorem for every helper.

The gate's fresh elaboration checks these explicit proof obligations and its declaration policy rejects holes and forbidden axioms. It inventories remaining declarations and does not infer missing specifications from names, counts, or digests. Semantic review MUST still establish adequacy and completeness: all relevant roots and boundaries are covered, and the required propositions express the intended behavior, including admission, success and refusal, update, frame, and composition where those are part of the claim. Deleting or weakening the requirement itself, or changing the caller to bypass its interface, changes the specification or its application linkage and requires that review. A gate PASS alone is not a contract-completeness verdict.

## 8.6 Classify Lean Computation Mechanisms Exactly

These mechanisms affect different Lean claims and MUST NOT be conflated:

| Mechanism | Exact Lean consequence | Positive proof surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ordinary terminating `def` | Lean accepts a kernel definition, with structural or well-founded termination justification when recursion requires it; code generation may add the narrowly authenticated internal helper described in §8.4 | permitted, subject to its axioms and profile |
| `opaque` with a body | the body is kernel-checked but is not available to ordinary client reduction; it is not a logical axiom | permitted when the API claim matches that reduction boundary |
| `noncomputable` | records that Lean need not generate executable code for the declaration; it introduces no logical axiom by itself | permitted and reported |
| `decide p` / `by decide` | `decide p` returns a `Bool` from a `Decidable p` instance; the tactic `by decide` constructs a proof when the decision reduces appropriately, without adding a native-proof axiom | permitted, subject to transitive axioms |
| `native_decide` / native proof | executes compiled code and adds a generated axiom asserting the result used by the proof | compiler-trusting; banned |
| `partial def` | supplies executable recursion without a kernel termination proof; the logical-facing declaration is an opaque constant whose compiled execution runs the generated partial helper | authored `partial` declarations are escape hatches: banned; partial computation reached from an executable root is reported as a trusted execution boundary |
| `unsafe def` / unsafe declaration | excluded from safe kernel definitions and checked proof terms; intended for compiled execution | authored unsafe declarations are escape hatches: banned; unsafe computation reached from an executable root is reported as a trusted execution boundary |
| `@[implemented_by]` | kernel reasoning uses the reference definition while compiled execution uses a different definition | permitted only as a reported execution boundary: trusted unless checked correspondence evidence relates the replacement to the reference; never an unconditional one-definition execution claim |
| `@[csimp]` | the pinned compiler substitutes a constant using an unconditional constant-equality declaration; kernel reduction is unchanged | prefer when this proof-backed form fits; the exact equality and every further execution boundary still require classification |
| `@[extern]` / FFI | compiled execution calls external or runtime code whose behavior is not established by the Lean declaration alone | permitted only as a reported execution boundary: toolchain runtime primitives (origin-checked `Init` modules, such as `Nat`/`Float32` arithmetic) are trusted native-runtime substrate; any other extern is trusted external code; neither is ever checked correspondence |
| `#eval` or native execution output | an observation from evaluation, not a proof term | never proof evidence |

The native-runtime exception requires module-origin evidence: the owning module is `Init` or a submodule, and Lean's resolved `.olean` path, after resolving symbolic links, equals that module's corresponding path in the pinned toolchain's library directory. A project or dependency module named `Init.Adopter` does not become toolchain substrate by its name. Missing origin evidence cannot authorize the exception. This check assumes the pinned toolchain installation and Lean process are trusted under §8.5.

Logical decidability, executable decidability, kernel reduction, code generation, and native execution are separate questions. Transfer of a property from a reference definition to a replacement requires the relevant relation, established by reduction or a checked proof. A theorem relating Lean definitions does not establish the behavior of external machine code; that boundary needs its own account.

### Execution roots and conservative coverage

**Execution coverage is a distinct account from the logical audit.** The foundation labels of §8.5 are purely logical: a Standard-Logical PASS never asserts execution correspondence. For each owned executable root — a computable, safe, non-partial, non-internal, non-proposition definition or opaque constant whose result is not a `Sort`, including the `main` of a claimed executable and eligible eliminator/matcher machinery, even when unused — the gate MUST account for supported compiler transformations and logical value dependencies. Logical expressions alone do not establish execution coverage. On Lean `4.34.0` (`293d5d0c0c3f3dded4688b3ccd6a33939ac5102b`), `CSimp.replaceConstant` performs one lookup per invocation: `ToDecl.replaceLogicConstants` invokes it before macro inlining, and `ToLCNF` invokes it again during conversion; `implemented_by` is applied during later simplification, and inlining or specialization can erase intermediate calls. A later attribute assignment can change the final environment without changing already compiled code. These facts preclude reconstructing every replacement choice from the final attribute map or optimized code alone.

The checker's finite, conservative closure is the least set containing the executable root and closed under retained compiler calls, closures, initializers, constants in the logical values of unreplaced non-proof definitions, constant-equality replacement candidates in the pinned `csimp` form, observed `implemented_by` choices, and partial helpers' bodies. `@[extern]` declarations are boundary leaves for their Lean bodies. `implemented_by` reference bodies are likewise not descended, while their replacement targets are expanded. Imported declarations remain unowned. Retained compiled edges come from the pinned compiler IR; the [producer guide](../guides/engine-producers.md#reached-closure-and-source-snapshot-account) identifies the collector API and its treatment of recursive calls. Private module data and full IR are loaded through Lean's import semantics. A compiler-only generated node need not have a kernel declaration, but its compiled body MUST be available. A missing retained dependency or an opaque export placeholder is unresolved, not an empty body. The logical-value scan is conservative: it can include constants in erased proof or type arguments within a data-producing definition. It does not descend into separate theorem bodies or proof-valued definitions merely to reconstruct native execution.

Auxiliary-recursor, no-confusion and matcher metadata MUST NOT remove an otherwise eligible root from that account. Such logical/compiler machinery, projections, macro-inline definitions and the pinned generated `brecOn` helper can lack standalone IR. This exception relaxes only the initial root's standalone-IR obligation; its actual values, runtime attributes and every available compiled body remain inspected. Every dependency actually retained in IR still requires its compiled body, even if it carries one of these tags. Tags do not authenticate generation. The conservative account does not establish that each logical machinery root independently compiles into a callable function.

Equality candidates include proof-valued definitions and theorems with exactly the constant heads and matching distinct universe parameters that the pinned `csimp` attribute accepts. This overapproximation retains possible local or overwritten simplifications even when the final scoped attribute state has lost their registration. A candidate does not assert that compilation selected it. Each candidate's correspondence must pass the kernel admission below before it can be reported as checked. Following candidate targets to a fixed point conservatively accounts for chains and does not claim the compiler recursively rewrites one constant to that fixed point.

For a reached `implemented_by` reference, an isolated fresh frontend re-elaborates its Lean-resolved source and records the implementation maps in nested command contexts, preserving earlier targets overwritten by later attributes. Results are reused once per module within the report. Source is compared byte-for-byte before and after this inspection. Missing source, failed replay, a current target absent from the history, or an unsupported source evaluator leaves the path unresolved. Source metaprograms such as `run_cmd`, `run_meta`, `run_elab`, `run_tac`, `by_elab`, and module-local or ambiguous elaborators cannot authorize history from command snapshots because they can change and restore a mapping within a command. This uses the §8.5 supported process and imported-library trust boundary. It is not a claim against compromised processes or arbitrary trusted plugins. Other compiler pins are unsupported until their semantics are qualified.

Ordinary recursive call graphs use a visited-set fixed point. A cycle consisting solely of active `csimp` or observed `implemented_by` edges is explicitly unresolved and is not silently discarded as a completed traversal. Conservative candidates and historical choices can reject a program whose particular compiled path is safe. The report MUST distinguish this candidate account from the retained compiled edges rather than describe it as a minimal runtime call graph.

### Boundary kinds and evidence

Each reported boundary entry has a kind and correspondence state. A declaration may have several entries, such as multiple replacement candidates:

- kinds: `runtime-replacement` (`@[implemented_by]`), `compiler-simplification` (a possible constant-equality replacement, not necessarily an active registration), `native-runtime` (an extern resolved from the pinned toolchain's `Init` modules), `external` (any other extern/FFI), `unsafe-computation`, `partial-computation` (including a partial definition's erased opaque constant, detected through its generated partial helper), `opaque-computation`, and `compiler-trusted-proof` (native-proof or `trustCompiler`-family axioms in the closure);
- **checked**: kernel-verified correspondence — a closed proof inhabits the exact proposition `∀ xs, f.{us} xs = g.{us} xs`, where `us` are the reference's universally quantified level parameters and `xs` is its complete elaborated dependent domain (including implicit, typeclass, and proof parameters), with the replacement instantiated at the compiler's same positional levels. The proof and its owned logical dependencies MUST pass checked admission before the proof is accepted against that proposition and have only standard-logical transitive axioms. Definitional equality, whole-function equality, and pointwise equality are possible proof sources, not alternative admission criteria. No expression or universe metavariables, free term variables, or additional undischarged theorem-only hypotheses may remain. An actual domain hypothesis is legitimate; an extra premise such as `False` cannot justify unconditional agreement unless discharged. For `opaque-computation`, **checked** instead records that the opaque constant has a kernel-checked body. It does not establish a separate compiler-correctness theorem; reached execution boundaries still require classification;
- **trusted**: the analyzed path has a boundary without the required kernel evidence — native-runtime primitives, external/FFI code, unproven replacements, unsafe/partial computation, and compiler-trusting proof axioms;
- **unresolved**: the analysis could not resolve or classify the path — a constant missing from the environment, unavailable module attribution, an unexpected compiled-helper shape, or a comparison that could not complete. A completed negative definitional comparison does not refute propositional equality; without another admitted proof, a replacement remains trusted.

### Reports and execution modes

Gate output, both text and `--json-out`, reports per-surface and per-file execution coverage: roots, each boundary's kind, correspondence, replacement, evidence, and every unresolved path, so a proved property and a trusted boundary are never conflated. Replacement evidence identifies conservative equality candidates. `compilerEdges` records retained IR edges separately, and `compilerCallers` identifies compiled calls to a reported boundary in both text and JSON. Replacement evidence reports the selected instantiated proof term and its exact required type, with universes and implicit arguments shown. The checker constructs this obligation in `StrictLean.Probe.replacementCorrespondence` and admits evidence only through `checkCorrespondenceProof`. Its theorem search supports equality in either direction at any prefix of the actual domain, applying remaining arguments by congruence. Search is deliberately incomplete: a candidate whose remaining premises cannot be instantiated supplies no evidence; a replacement without an admitted proof stays trusted, and an unsupported obligation shape is unresolved. Equality between Lean definitions does not discharge any extern or native boundary reached through the replacement. The execution claim has two modes:

- `report` (the default): trusted boundaries are reported but do not fail. Unresolved paths always block the affected execution claim (`execution-unresolved`).
- `checked` (a per-surface `"execution": "checked"` manifest key or `--execution checked` for single-file audits): every non-native-runtime boundary MUST be checked. A trusted replacement, external, unsafe, partial, or compiler-trusting boundary fails with `execution-trusted-boundary`. Native-runtime primitives remain permitted but reported. They are the toolchain execution substrate under the §8.5 assurance boundary, not correspondence a source-level audit can discharge.

An unknown `execution` value and any boundary the classification cannot account for fail closed.

## 8.7 Check Lean Documentation Verbatim

**Requirement**: Every Markdown file in the normative documentation tree, including nested directories, MUST have every Lean fence classified and checked on the declared toolchain.

The fence protocol is:

- an unmarked `lean` fence is positive and MUST first elaborate exactly as printed, with no checker imports or wrappers inserted into the source being tested;
- an immediately adjacent `<!-- lean-fail: PATTERN -->` marker makes the next `lean` fence a negative example; the non-empty diagnostic pattern MUST be valid, the frontend worker MUST complete with a source rejection, and one effective-error diagnostic MUST match the entire pattern. The pattern grammar is intentionally small and Lean-native: `|` separates alternatives, `.*` separates ordered literal fragments, an optional leading `(?s)` is accepted for compatibility. Each alternative and ordered fragment must be nonempty. Matching searches one typed error message, including its multiline continuation; it never joins messages or matches informational output. `(?s)` does not change that behavior. A worker crash, missing completion record, setup failure, or timeout is not an expected source rejection. Remaining characters are literal, except that `[](){}?+^$`, backslash, and a `*` outside `.*` are rejected as unsupported regex syntax;
- an immediately adjacent `<!-- lean-trusted-compiler -->` marker identifies a teaching example that intentionally demonstrates a compiler-trusting mechanism; it MUST elaborate and be classified, but it MUST NOT count as a conforming positive proof surface; and
- non-Lean sketches use another fence language and MUST NOT be described as compiling Lean.

After a positive fence elaborates verbatim, the checker MUST complete the shared admission checks for the fence and its owned imports, then inspect its resulting module environment and apply the declaration and axiom rules above. The shipped fence audit admits positives under Standard-Logical; a narrower foundation claim or an execution-correspondence claim in the surrounding prose needs its own evidence. Fence success alone establishes neither. Instrumentation may inspect a compiled temporary module; it may not change the imports or elaboration context of the source whose success is claimed.

Fences routinely import the checked project's own modules. Before elaborating any fence, this repository's fence audit builds the manifest's claimed libraries and executable roots in an isolated disposable copy (the §8.3 mechanism), requires that build to succeed warning-free, and elaborates and inspects every fence against the copy's exact Lake search path. It never relies on a prior `lake build` in the main checkout. An owned module that is missing, stale, or warning-producing fails the audit rather than silently resolving from pre-existing build output. The copy's build and every fence worker run with the invoking process's inherited `LEAN_PATH` and `LEAN_SRC_PATH` removed (`lake exe` exports the main checkout's search path, and `lake env` would append it after the workspace's own entries). So a fence import that the fresh claimed-surface build did not produce fails instead of resolving from pre-existing build output. The public §8.8 control injects such a stale search-path entry and requires that failure.

Trusted-compiler fences are re-elaborated by the fresh-frontend transcript inside an isolated inspection worker for generated-role attribution (§8.4), so their imports are paid twice: once in the fence compilation worker and once in the inspection worker. A trusted fence SHOULD import the smallest module that states its mechanism. `import Init` suffices for `native_decide` examples, not `Mathlib.Tactic`. The audit prints and flushes a progress line at each phase (fence inventory, fresh claimed-surface build, fence compilation, each inspection group), so a killed or resource-exhausted run names the phase it died in rather than exiting silently.

The scanner MUST fail on unclosed fences, invalid or empty diagnostic patterns, orphan markers, markers followed by a non-Lean fence, multiple markers targeting one fence, a marker left at end of file, and any HTML comment beginning with `lean` that is not an exact marker. A misspelled marker must not silently demote its fence to a positive example. For positive and trusted-compiler fences, the audit MUST reject warnings from the actual Lean diagnostics even if the example locally disables `warningAsError`, in both the `warning:` and the named `warning(name):` rendering.

## 8.8 Qualify Checker Implementations with Independent Mutations

**Conditional requirement**: A claimed checker detection capability MUST have qualification evidence for its supported Lean toolchain and actual detection implementation. When implementation or configuration changes, identify which capabilities and invocation paths the change can affect and obtain focused evidence for those capabilities. Existing evidence remains usable for behavior whose implementation, dependencies, and invocation contract are unchanged. A new checker version or an unrelated fixture edit does not by itself require repeating the complete qualification suite. Qualification observations establish the exercised detector behavior, not universal checker correctness.

Each mutation MUST introduce one intended defect into an otherwise passing disposable surface. The run must establish the intended failure reason, remove the mutation and all generated Lean artifacts, and re-establish the green control. Compound fixtures that fail first for an unrelated reason do not validate later checks.

Qualification MUST exercise the checker's actual detection implementation, through its public entrypoint or the same implementation functions. It MUST NOT substitute independently reimplemented detection logic. A changed public invocation, transport, or integration path requires an end-to-end control through that path; otherwise applicable existing integration evidence may be reused. An in-process control establishes only the path it exercises.

Share an unchanged workspace, baseline, and loaded environment where the control remains valid. Keep mutation artifacts separate from restored controls. Clean-checkout, packaging, adopter, and build-integration diagnostics apply when those mechanisms change or their qualification is explicitly claimed. The complete diagnostic campaign remains available for broad qualification; it is not a mandatory gate for every checker change.

The following catalogue describes the shipped diagnostic campaign. Select controls by the affected capability; the catalogue is not a per-change execution checklist. A report claiming complete campaign coverage must establish every listed applicable result:

- Kernel-only, Choice-Free, and Standard-Logical positive declarations;
- unchecked declarations admitted by local options, restored options, or direct APIs; forged correspondence dependencies; valid checked and preliminary-then-checked controls;
- negative diagnostics occurring only in non-error output, patterns split across errors, legitimate multiline errors, and abnormal worker termination;
- direct and transitive project axioms;
- `sorry`, attributed theorems, proof-valued definitions, and proof-valued instances;
- direct and transitive `Classical.choice` against a Choice-Free claim;
- project axioms attempting to imitate a native generated name or the complete final semantic shape of a native proof while originating in a custom frontend;
- user declarations with private/internal/auxiliary-looking names;
- native proofs, an authenticated safe-recursion control, an authored unsafe-recursion-name spoof, a custom-command forgery of the complete helper metadata shape, a `run_tac` forgery nested in an ordinary built-in declaration, custom tactic- and term-elaborator forgeries of the same helper evidence, a `by_elab` forgery, and `partial`, ordinary, and opaque `unsafe` declarations as escape hatches;
- an owned `@[implemented_by]` replacement and an owned `@[extern]` declaration as permitted-but-reported trusted execution boundaries, an unmarked `Float32` wrapper whose passing standard-logical label coexists with a trusted native-runtime boundary, a proved replacement correspondence passing a checked-correspondence execution claim, legitimate dependent/proof domains and general universes, and independent conditional-premise, specialized-universe, and restricted-input equalities that cannot establish the full correspondence. Exercise whole-function and partial/pointwise proofs as controls, with repeated or omitted input arguments unable to weaken the required proposition. The same replacement shape without evidence must fail the checked claim, and unresolved execution paths block the execution claim in every mode. A real toolchain runtime primitive remains reported and permitted in checked mode; an extern in a project or dependency module with an `Init` name must remain external and fail that mode;
- imported `csimp` controls in legacy and module-system Lean files, chained and both-order `csimp`/`implemented_by` interactions, reachable extern/unsafe/partial targets, expired local and overwritten simplifications, proof-valued simplification evidence, and overwritten inlined implementations. Each gets an independent passing control, intended-reason mutation, and fresh restored control through the public file entrypoint; imported extern controls also exercise the project entrypoint. Require explicit cycle/unsupported-history failures. Inspect emitted code for a diagnostic external target without linking or executing it; that observation qualifies discovery and does not prove compiler correctness or external implementation equality;
- a new module discovered through the Lake library glob, an exact module-name lookalike, and a root-owned module outside every library, plus a negative-fixture import into the positive surface;
- an audited-module command registration that collides with the interactive probe token while the trusted runner still inventories and rejects a seeded project axiom;
- missing, malformed, or semantically incomplete surface manifests, including an unclassified root-package Lean library or `lean_exe` target, a claimed executable root whose source is removed, and a claimed executable root importing an excluded fixture module;
- for the complete-application control, an omitted executable classification, a deleted required update proof, an unrelated trivial proof, an extra-premise weakened proof, a missing proof field, and a weakened admission guard. Each fails for its own missing obligation or coverage diagnostic, not an injected axiom;
- warning suppression, holes, and forbidden axioms in documentation fences; and
- every malformed marker/fence state listed in §8.7.

The qualification harness MUST use unique temporary paths. It MUST NOT overwrite fixed positive-source files in place or leave `.olean` files that could satisfy a later control. These tests qualify a checker implementation and do not add a second proof obligation to each theorem in a project that uses the checker.

## 8.9 Optional Fresh Serialized-Graph Checking

**Optional additional claim**: The ordinary conformance gate combines fresh warning-free elaboration with completed owned logical admission under §8.3. A project MAY additionally claim that its serialized `.olean` graph was rechecked in a separate compatible checker state. That additional claim is not required for ordinary conformance to the proof, declaration, or axiom rules.

For toolchains that provide Lean's bundled checker, this repository implements the additional check with:

```sh
lake exe freshChecker --verbose
```

`leanchecker --fresh` reads produced `.olean` files and rechecks serialized declarations in a fresh checker state. It does not prove a stronger theorem than the fresh source build, and it does not replace source elaboration, warning checking, module discovery, foundation classification, or documentation checks.

The driver derives transitive imports through Lake's module facets, selects every maximal claimed module as a fresh root, intersects each root's closure with the exact claimed inventory, and requires the union to equal that inventory. A claimed standalone executable root that no other claimed module imports is maximal and appears as its own fresh root. If one umbrella root does not cover every module, the driver invokes `leanchecker --fresh` on the additional roots. Because `leanchecker` reads the produced `.olean` files, the driver first builds the manifest's claimed libraries and executable roots and requires that build to succeed warning-free. The rechecked graph is therefore up to date according to Lake’s dependency traces for that build. This build is incremental and can reuse existing artifacts. “Fresh” describes the separate checker state, not a rebuild from empty output. This driver does not establish §8.3’s fresh-source evidence. A project that makes this optional serialized-graph claim MUST reject unsupported, skipped, timed-out, or partially covered runs; otherwise the additional claim is unverified. Omitting the additional claim does not weaken or change the foundation label of a kernel-checked declaration.

## 8.10 Dogfooding

The Strict Lean repository applies the applicable universal rules to itself and qualifies the checker implementations it publishes:

- the `Audit` Lake library uses an all-submodules glob, and Lake's elaborated module inventory is the source of truth for its module set;
- `lean/Audit/` is one positive surface and contains no project axioms, holes, compiler-trusting proofs, authored partial/unsafe declarations, runtime replacements, or external declarations; generated partial helpers for safe recursion are separately authenticated under §8.4;
- the `AuditApp` library and claimed `auditApp` executable (standalone root `Main`) apply the complete-program contracts from [§3.7](3-logic-proof-patterns.md#37-a-compositional-method-for-complete-program-contracts) to their actual Lean definitions. `RequiredContracts` states the required propositions and `requiredContracts` supplies their proofs. `executeChecked` requires that evidence, admits capacity, and runs the strict state/error script. Its success, first-refusal, and append theorems describe the retained successful prefix; the intrinsic `Limiter` bound supplies the state invariant. `checkedExecutable` registers the exact admission/runner relation through `ExecutableContract`, reusing `executeChecked_exact`, and `Main` invokes its `run` entrypoint with `requiredContracts`. The total `run` and `execute` also remain available, so semantic review must inspect the actual caller. In `report` mode, the `IO` shell and reached native mechanisms are reported as execution boundaries. These pure contracts do not prove terminal effects or compiler/runtime correctness;
- the trusted environment probe and its typed records live in the checker library (`StrictLean.Probe`, `StrictLean.Report`), which is excluded from the claimed surface; the checker supplies them through its own force import. Any other module in the audited import environment that directly imports either of them, in whatever package, fails as `unexpected-project-module` (a §8.8 structural control; Lake resolves imports workspace-wide, so the scan covers every module's recorded direct imports). `StrictLean.Contract`, the published contract interface (§8.12), is the one checker module a claimed module imports by design; its declarations belong to no claimed surface and, like the probe, resolve from the checker's own compiled-module overlay. `lean/Audit/` contains mathematical models, proofs, and executable Lean examples; it does not contain the checker implementation;
- `lean/Fixtures/` contains isolated positive controls and independent negative mutations and is not imported by the positive surface;
- the checker executables (`axiomGate`, `docFenceAudit`, `freshChecker`, `checkerSelftest`) are discovered as root-package `lean_exe` targets and recorded in `excluded-executables`: they are operational tooling whose root modules belong to the excluded `StrictLean` library, qualified by the §8.8 mutation suite rather than claimed as a proof surface;
- every normative Lean fence is checked verbatim before environment inspection;
- checker changes receive focused qualification for affected capabilities under §8.8; unchanged capability evidence is reused; and
- when this repository claims separate serialized-graph checking, it runs a fresh `leanchecker` pass over every declared root needed for complete module coverage.

## 8.11 Adopting the Checker in Another Project

The checker package is self-contained: an external Lean project adopts it by requiring the package and adding a surface manifest at its own root, with no Lake facets, module names, or fixture layout borrowed from this repository.

- The adopting project MAY use an ordinary `lakefile.lean` or `lakefile.toml`; both load through the same Lake workspace discovery (§8.2). A project providing both files is ambiguous and fails closed.
- The adopter classifies every root-package `lean_lib` and `lean_exe` in `foundation_manifest.json` at its project root (or at an explicit `--manifest PATH`), with empty exclusion arrays when nothing is excluded.
- The trusted environment probe (`StrictLean.Probe`) and its typed records (`StrictLean.Report`) ship inside the checker library. Modules resolving from the checker package's own compiled-module directory are tooling infrastructure and are never attributed to an adopter's surface.
- The checker library and executables import no Mathlib modules. A Core/Std-only adopter compiles only its own claimed surface plus the already-compiled checker; the checker package's transitive `require`s resolve into the adopter's `lake-manifest.json` as usual but are not compiled unless the adopter's own code imports them.
- Runs execute from the adopter's project root or an explicit `--project DIR`. Scratch work, including the §8.3 isolated disposable copy, uses a temporary directory under the checked project's `tmp/` and is removed afterward.
- The normal project-wide gate builds in its own isolated copy (§8.3), so it does not need a preliminary build of the claimed surface in the main checkout. Single-file audits and the enforcing build linter use incremental builds in the target checkout. Establish a shared baseline before concurrent qualification runs, and avoid concurrent builds writing the same workspace output. Separate audit copies still share dependency checkouts, whose missing artifacts may need building.

The exact adapter steps, including glob syntax in both lakefile formats and a minimal manifest, are in this repository's [adoption guide](../guides/adoption.md).

## 8.12 Opt-in Enforcing Build Linter

An adopter MAY enable the shipped whole-surface Lean build linter. Once enabled, it MUST enforce its selected foundation and execution requirements: an emitted source warning, a policy violation, or an unresolved claimed path fails the build. This mode is not advisory and does not use source-local linter suppression options to authorize exceptions.

The [complete minimal adopter](../../examples/build-lint/) contains the public recipe:

1. Require the pinned checker package in `lakefile.lean` and import `StrictLean.Contract` where executable contracts are declared.
2. Classify every root-package library and executable in `foundation_manifest.json` (§8.2). Select `kernel-only`, `choice-free`, or `standard-logical` and `report` or `checked`.
3. Copy the sample's `policy` target and make it the **sole default target**. It obtains `axiomGate` from the `strict_lean` package through Lake, then invokes its `--build-lint` mode for the consuming package.
4. Run ordinary `lake build`. The target builds the linter, then the linter builds the exact manifest-derived library/executable targets incrementally and inspects the completed environments. It never recursively invokes the default target.

This uses Lake's native custom-target/job API. A per-declaration linter or a separate lint command alone does not establish this complete ordinary-build claim. The build target instead reuses the existing `Admission.validate`, `Probe.environmentReport`, `Policy.reasonFor`, `Policy.executionFailures`, Lake discovery, and fresh evaluator attribution. It adds no second foundation or execution policy.

### Exact contract and coverage scope

The public proof API is `ExecutableContract implementation condition : Prop`, with a field `evidence : condition implementation`. A **closed declaration** of this type registers a promised executable. Its elaborated predicate is applied to the actual constant by the type, so unrelated or weakened evidence cannot inhabit the unchanged requirement. `contract.run` returns that constant and requires the contract during elaboration ([module 3 §3.8](3-logic-proof-patterns.md#38-delivering-executable-witnesses-with-required-evidence)). The proof is erased at runtime; this API does not perform a runtime validation. Application-specific proof interfaces remain valid, and callers that bypass a proof-requiring interface need separate review.

For this registration API, the implementation must be a named `def` or body-bearing `opaque` producing runtime data, with its entire argument domain inside the predicate. The linter rejects noncomputable, unsafe, partial, proof-valued, or type-producing roots, partial applications, and parameterized registrations. Universe-polymorphic constants are permitted; term parameters outside the predicate are unsupported. The report prints the registered root and its required proposition. Lean checks the evidence; the gate checks its transitive axioms against the selected surface policy, as it does for every other owned declaration.

The tool inspects all exact Lake-owned declarations, including private, generated, and unused declarations. The ordinary executable roots of §8.6 remain covered; explicitly registered private or imported roots additionally receive the same conservative execution closure. Imported roots remain unowned, but their reached boundaries and transitive logical dependencies do not disappear. An erased classical correctness proof is permitted under Standard-Logical; it does not by itself make its function noncomputable. `extern`, `implemented_by`, `csimp`, unsafe/partial targets, and unresolved paths retain the exact §8.6 policy and supported-process boundary.

### Build and cache semantics

- The `policy` job has no cached success artifact. Every enabled default build reloads the manifest and Lake inventory and reinspects the completed module environments, even if all `.olean` files were reused. A changed profile or execution policy therefore cannot inherit an old linter verdict. Added glob-discovered modules are inspected without umbrella imports.
- Source and imported-dependency invalidation use Lake's ordinary dependency traces. The claimed modules finish building before policy inspection; no per-declaration hook launches a build. Generated-role and replacement-history checks still require the existing fresh, exact-source frontend attribution where applicable, memoized within each report.
- This is **incremental elaboration plus current policy inspection**, not §8.3's fresh-source conformance evidence. It trusts Lake's build cache and the pinned supported process. The ordinary fresh `axiomGate` remains available and required for that conformance claim; documentation and semantic matrix rows remain separate.
- The supported enforcing path is the sample's `lakefile.lean` default target and plain `lake build` (or explicit `lake build policy`). Direct `lean`, editor elaboration, `lake build Widget`, another default target, and `lakefile.toml` without an equivalent qualified adapter do not invoke this policy target and MUST NOT be reported as enforced. Do not install it as a library/package `extraDepTargets` prerequisite, which would create a cycle with the modules it builds, or combine it with concurrent builds of those modules.
- Removing the default target disables policy enforcement; ordinary Lean typing still checks explicit evidence arguments. Removing or narrowing requirements, intentionally changing library globs or exclusions, and bypassing proof-requiring callers change the claim itself. Semantic review MUST establish intended coverage and contract adequacy. A linter PASS alone establishes neither intended coverage nor full-standard conformance.

### Qualification

The build-bound `checkerSelftest` suite copies the public sample into isolated standalone adopters. It drives actual `lake build`: all three profiles, direct/transitive choice, classical erased evidence, missing/unrelated/weakened evidence, noncomputable witnesses, unsupported registrations, private and imported executable boundaries, unimported configured modules, unclassified libraries, configuration changes, cached failures, disabled/reenabled behavior, and fresh restoration. The same tier's external-adopter phase runs `axiomGate` from scratch adopters that require the checker by absolute path in both lakefile formats and by relative path (the nested-repository form), so an actual gate run exercises the §8.3 copy's re-anchoring of relative `path` dependencies, and the tier's structural warning-suppression control requires a warning's continuation text in the gate transcript. Unchanged compiler-path controls additionally qualify the shared §8.6 machinery; they are not rerun from each adopter build. These controls establish diagnostic qualification, not a universal proof of the linter implementation.

## Summary

The machine audit accounts for the declared elaboration environment, exact claimed Lake modules, fresh warning-free root-package elaboration, every owned declaration and its transitive axioms, the selected execution mode, and the classified documentation fences. Semantic review must additionally establish that the intended claims, required contracts, and implementation linkage match that evidence. A checker implementation additionally needs the §8.8 qualification evidence for the behaviors it claims. Serialized-graph checking is a separate optional §8.9 claim. Unknowns, omissions, and skipped checks fail the specific claim they affect.
