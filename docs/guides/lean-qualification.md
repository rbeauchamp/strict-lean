# Lean qualification tooling

Project-owned implementation follows the Lean 4 policy in `AGENTS.md`, not
in the universal standard. The sixteen former Python entrypoints listed below have Lean
replacements; ordinary acceptance, the producer/history/corpus CI campaigns, and the
prototype do not need a Python interpreter. The four remaining acceptance, snapshot,
documentation-dependency and input-inventory drivers were retired after their native
controls passed. The [earlier receipt](../../session/evidence/ci-environment-census.md)
and [completion receipt](../../session/evidence/ci-role-retention.md) retain the
control mapping, runtime results, failed attempts and evidence-reuse boundaries.
Historical implementations remain in Git history; use the Lean commands below.
The prototype's project-owned JavaScript widget was also removed. External Lean, Lake,
Verso, runtime libraries and generated browser assets remain external dependencies, not
claims of a wholly Lean or formally verified toolchain.

## Why retain these controls?

They are integration qualification, not alternative implementations of policy. A theorem
about a pure policy function cannot establish that the CLI called it, that warnings were
promoted, that the compiler supplied the right source range, or that a static renderer
produced a page. Deleting those observations would lose real coverage under standard §8.8.
Conversely, passing these controls never proves arbitrary compiler or OS behavior.

| Former entrypoint | Lean replacement | Retained purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `registry_cli_checks.py` | `lake exe qualify registry` | Seven malformed CLI invocations must invalidate seeded stale output. |
| `native_linter_checks.py` | `lake exe qualify native` | 36 real compiler controls: identity, multiplicity, severity, source ranges, documentation and metadata ownership. |
| `producer_checks.py` | `lake exe qualify producers` | 18 source-owned documentation controls, eight existing transport mutations, three standalone-executable controls. |
| `history_checks.py` | `lake exe qualify history` | Seventeen project/file invocations, private/imported roots, reached-closure/source accounts, and transport mutations. |
| `closure_evidence_checks.py` | `lake exe qualify closure-evidence` | Reflexive candidate versus active cycle, retained recursive IR edges, and range refusals through four invocation paths. |
| `configuration_capture_checks.py` | `lake exe qualify configuration-capture` | Initial configuration IO failure through project/file result protocols. |
| `documentation_source_checks.py` | `lake exe qualify documentation-source` | Frozen dependency/configuration changes through both documentation commands; `--source-read-only` adds file/build read-failure controls. |
| `fence_evidence_checks.py` | `lake exe qualify fence-evidence` | Independent range, admission, policy and compiler failures inside positive fences, plus restoration. |
| `frozen_exit_checks.py` | `lake exe qualify frozen-exits` | Frozen-input rechecks after imports and failed build/compilation operations. |
| `native_launcher_diagnostic.py` | `lake exe qualify native-launcher` | 36 paired baseline/cached-environment controls; exact source, argv, outputs and in-memory environment/executable equality. |
| `rule_example_checks.py` | `lake exe qualify rule-examples --evidence PATH` | Sixty source-owned phases for twenty rules, plus admission mutations and authentic wrong-claim/classification controls. |
| prototype `run.py` | `lake env lean --run examples/rule-reference-prototype/Run.lean` | Separately pinned Verso integration, native messages, Lake dependency dispatch and identical-output comparison. |
| `acceptance_checks.py` | `lake exe qualify acceptance GROUP --evidence PATH` | Surface/evidence/fence packet mutations, source request binding, worker failure and timeout, with positive restoration. Groups: `surface`, `evidence`, `fences`, `sources`, `process`. |
| `acceptance_snapshot_checks.py` | `lake exe qualify acceptance-snapshots dependencies` and `lake exe qualify acceptance-snapshots history` | Ignored Git/non-Git dependency input coverage and mutation; SL3001 fresh/incremental/build-lint history refusal and restoration. `all` runs both under one deadline. |
| `documentation_dependency_checks.py` | `lake exe qualify documentation-dependencies` | Both documentation commands retain pre-build dependency observations; combined project/documentation positive remains distinct. |
| `input_inventory_checks.py` | `lake exe qualify input-inventory` | Root additions and Markdown edit/removal during prerequisite build; actual new-module build and restored fresh controls. |

The producer command retains `--evidence PATH`. `scripts/verify.sh` runs registry and native
controls; `scripts/verify.sh diagnostics producers` and `scripts/verify.sh diagnostics history`
run the producer and history campaigns separately and sequentially in CI.
Each invocation retains its own hard 420-second deadline. Direct `lake exe qualify`
campaigns have a single 420-second process-group deadline; the prototype has a single
600-second process-group deadline. These replace the old per-child timers, which cannot
safely enforce descendant termination while sharing acceptance's outer process group.
The prototype never substitutes for acceptance. `diagnostics rule-examples` retains the
upstream corpus selection; optional `--rules RULE ...` follows `--evidence PATH` on the
standalone command and never claims full-corpus coverage. The corpus runner retains at
most two disjoint detector processes, consumes records in fixed order, and drains launched
tasks before ordinary/exceptional scratch cleanup. Partial exports remain `INCOMPLETE`.
Corpus records use a qualification-only view: top-level `acceptance` and
`documentationAcceptance` payloads become null, while every key, required nested value
and raw-tree shape remains unchanged. Exact detector bytes remain in
`PATH.raw/ATTEMPT/RULE/PHASE/result.json`, with registered command/request/snapshots,
stream files, terminal metadata and the compact original record. Derived admission
mutations retain their exact submitted record, origin path and mutation label before
admission under the original phase's `controls/` directory. During production the
INCOMPLETE receipt points to these sidecars; the full aggregate is written once all
records and controls are ready. The runner verifies the retained files,
SHA256/length binding and terminal checker sources before exporting PASS. Missing or
changed sidecars refuse completion; kill paths retain INCOMPLETE and partial files.
PASS is written only after successful scratch cleanup.
Stream retention on kill covers completed lines already read; an unterminated line
can remain buffered. Only terminal observations claim complete streams.
The former launcher's separate 180-second diagnostic timer is replaced by the same
single 420-second public qualification boundary; no timing result is a future bound.

## Organization

- `lean/StrictLeanQualification/`: a separate **positive Lake library**, discovered through
  its all-submodules glob. It contains pure observation requirements and checked contracts,
  not process launchers. Testing requirements are not production policy, so this library
  does not belong in `StrictLeanPolicy`, nor in the mathematical `Audit` examples.
- `lean/StrictLean/Qualification/`: operational drivers, the single `qualify` Lake executable,
  and shared process/scratch/adopter support. These remain in the existing operational
  `StrictLean` library, explicitly excluded from the positive proof surface. Calling a
  proved oracle does not prove the entire driver or its IO effects.
- `lean/StrictLeanVerification.lean`: a separately claimed cold-start runner importing only
  the pinned toolchain. It owns argument selection, command recipes, sequential execution
  and success reporting. `scripts/verify.sh` only selects the root/GNU timeout and starts
  this runner under the external deadline, including all root-package builds.
- `examples/rule-reference-prototype/Run.lean`: the experiment-specific driver. It remains
  with its fixtures and separately pinned Verso package rather than becoming a checker
  dependency. Production website delivery remains separate work.

This uses normal Lean module factoring and Lake targets. It does not impose a universal
`tests/` directory convention or rename scripts while hiding another interpreter inside Lean.
The helpers invoke external programs with argv arrays, never generated shell programs.

## Exact proved boundary

All quantifiers below range over supplied Lean values, not external executions.
The IO drivers call the relevant `ExecutableContract.run`, so the evidence is required
by their source-level linkage. The proof is erased at execution.

- `Checks.evaluate_success`: evaluation returns success **iff** every supplied assertion
  is true. `evaluate_error` identifies a satisfied prefix and its first false assertion;
  `evaluate_append` specifies success/error composition. `checkedEvaluation` requires all
  three properties. Empty conjunction is permitted; each protocol supplies its own
  nonempty, explicit requirements.
- `Registry.validate_exact`: for every exit code and JSON tree, success **iff** the exit
  is nonzero, the root is an object, status is explicitly `incomplete`, and the seeded
  `old` key is absent (present-null is not absent).
- `Native.validate_exact`: for every expected result and decoded message list, success
  **iff** compiler messages match in order and length, native identities match with
  multiplicity, exit outcome and stderr agree, native file/severity/help fields agree,
  and any requested detail is present. `nativeMatches_exact` and
  `compilerMatches_exact` establish the field and ordered-list relations separately.
- `Json.validateDecoded_exact`: a decoding error always refuses; success **iff** decoding
  yields an assertion list whose every assertion holds. `History.requirements` and
  `Producer.requirements` spell out mandatory fields and their exact comparisons.
  Their registered contracts apply this equivalence to the actual decoders; they do
  **not** prove that the observations were extracted truthfully or that Lean's JSON
  parser implements a separately formalized JSON specification.
- `Evidence.checkedValidation` and `checkedDocumentation`: exact conjunctions of decoded
  status/diagnostic/exit and transcript requirements, including distinct fence/project
  admission messages and the underlying IO reason. IO-only controls also consume the
  shared assertion contract for their observed source, closure and configuration fields.
- `Launcher.admit` returns a proof-bearing mapping with nonempty unique names and both
  required search paths; its completeness theorem admits every valid decoded mapping.
  `checkedEquivalence` requires exactly 36 observations and full ordered equality,
  including source, arguments, stdout/stderr, exit, environment and resolved executable.
  Lake's actual environment is cached only within one fixed parent/workspace invocation,
  separately for the imported-control search-path override. Neither observations nor
  compiled artifacts are reused. Environment values are not exported. Durations are
  observations, not a speed guarantee or compiler-equivalence theorem.
- `Template.instantiate` returns a required `Maps` proof for the actual recursive JSON
  transformation: ordered array entries, object keys and scalar kinds are preserved;
  only entire matching string values change. Unmatched strings stay unchanged. Depth
  exhaustion explicitly refuses; the corpus uses a 64-level budget. Semantic module
  discovery for checker snapshots uses Lake's elaborated inventory, not a source glob.
- `Checker.RuleExampleProjection.qualify_record` and its mutation/checker-source
  variants prove exact `Except String Unit` equality for arbitrary producer JSON at
  the adapter's canonical record constructor. `qualifyCorpus_records` extends this
  to the unchanged full corpus qualifier, including ordered scans, completeness and
  first refusals. `withoutSourceAccount_view` covers the existing missing-source
  control. Structural raw-tree laws avoid assuming parser well-formedness. These
  separately checked operational-module proofs do not authenticate parsing,
  duplicate-key handling, serialization, hashes, filesystem custody or subprocesses.
- `Website.hasFence_exact`: the fence guard detects exactly a contiguous triple backtick
  in the input character list. `checkedBlock` specifies refusal or exact LF-normalized
  text wrapping. `checkedPage` admits exactly fence-free SL1001 inputs and returns a
  proof-bearing `Page input`: its bytes equal the canonical `pageText input`, including
  the supplied metadata and exact LF-normalized violation/diagnostic/fixed sections.
  `checkedArtifact` proves field-level preservation of required IDs, emitted IDs (order
  and multiplicity), route and the conjunction of observed checked-example conditions.
  The driver consumes these contracts. They do not establish Verso/browser correctness.
- `StrictLeanVerification.parseMode_sound`, `parseMode_roundtrip`, and `select_exact`
  prove exact argument binding and acceptance of every documented invocation. The caller
  consumes the proof-bearing selection; recipes name the intended commands explicitly.
  `commands_nonempty` rules out a selected empty campaign. Process execution remains IO.

The positive library is audited as `standard-logical`, `execution: report`. The gate
reports each declaration's exact axiom set and each reached execution boundary;
that surface profile is an upper bound, not a claim that every proof uses choice.
No `sorry`, project axiom, native proof, authored partial or unsafe definition is permitted
on that surface. The supplied-observation contracts do not certify the entire operational
checker or all project-owned Lean code as formally verified.

## Operational assumptions and approved bootstrap

The supported compiler, filesystem, process runtime and GNU timeout are trusted mechanisms.
Unique scratch directories are removed on normal or exceptional return; a killed process
cannot promise to run its cleanup handler. Each supported public invocation has one
non-foreground GNU timeout owning the whole process group, including descendants with
inherited output handles. Acceptance passes an internal `--under-deadline` protocol flag
to `qualify` so it does not detach a nested timer/group. That private flag is not a bounded
standalone invocation or an alternative acceptance command. `TimeoutControl.lean` separately
exercises positive, descendant timeout, terminated-descendant and restored controls.
These observations are not an OS scheduling theorem.

The acceptance `process` group additionally terminates a single native sleeper
inside a surface worker using a foreground timer. It checks actual worker
termination and the coordinator's incomplete/no-acceptance response. It does not
establish whole-coordinator cancellation; `TimeoutControl` retains the separate
process-group descendant controls. No nested timer creates an escaping group.

`lake exe qualify receipt-boundaries` seeds completed evidence and exercises
actual missing/unusable timeout selection and selected-timer spawn failures for
both `acceptance` and `environments`. Each public invocation replaces the old
receipt with a fresh incomplete attempt before those fallible operations. The
timed child carries the same attempt, and adds no new deadline. Acceptance keeps
existing raw result/trace sidecars before parsing and records partial file
locations on the active case; completed command records contain executable plus
argv. These are diagnostic receipt guarantees under trusted filesystem/process IO.

The operator approved a narrow exception for the existing CI bootstrap to install pinned
Elan/Lean and required system tools before Lean is available, expose their paths, and
check availability/versions. `AGENTS.md` records its exact scope: no policy decisions,
validation logic, or test orchestration in that shell step; expansion requires explicit
approval. Installation and runtime mechanisms remain trusted, not proved by Lean.
The nonessential shell resource-reporting block has been removed. Direct commands
in CI and developer setup examples are invocation recipes, not a second implementation
language for qualification logic.

No CI, publication, merge, actual VS Code interaction, or full repository semantic
conformance is implied by local acceptance or these scoped integration results.
